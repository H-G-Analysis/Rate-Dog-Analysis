# Dog Rate Analysis Project
## by (Hadeer Ismail Gado)


## Introduction
>Our goal is to use Python and its libraries to gather data from a variety of sources and in a variety of formats, assess its quality and tidiness, then clean it. The dataset is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. In gathering data stage we have 3 data resources. First, Reading tweet archive data downloaded as csv format. Second, Use Requests library to scrap image prediction data and store it in a csv file format. Third, Query Twitter API for each tweet in the Twitter archive and save JSON in a text file.
